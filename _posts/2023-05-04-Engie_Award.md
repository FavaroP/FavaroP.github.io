On May 04, 2023, I was awarded the Engie Award 2022 for my Master's Thesis on Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES). This prestigious award recognizes outstanding contributions to the energy transition. During the event, co-organized by the University of Mons, I presented my work in front of esteemed colleagues, including vice-rectors, and Engie representatives from Tractebel and Laborelec. It was truly gratifying to be part of an evening dedicated to the energy transition and the positive impact of collaboration between academia and industry. Receiving the award from Philippe De Raedemaeker, Scientific Director of Laborelec, and Diane Thomas, Vice-rector for the transitions, was a particularly moving moment for me.

A significant aspect of my thesis focused on demonstrating the economic value of the method we employed to optimize the day-ahead scheduling of PHES. This key point was particularly appreciated by the jury. In addition, the innovative integration of machine learning within optimization in order to inform the optimization process as precisely as possible was also highlighted.

I am very grateful to Engie for their support in facilitating research on the energy transition and selecting my work. I will strive to keep my research relevant and valuable for the industrial actors who play a pivotal role in the success of the energy transition.
